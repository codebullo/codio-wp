To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

	/home/codio/.parts/packages/mysql/5.6.15/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
	/home/codio/.parts/packages/mysql/5.6.15/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h mailbox-spoon password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:                                                                        

	/home/codio/.parts/packages/mysql/5.6.15/bin/mysql_secure_installation


which will also give you the option of removing the test                                          
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is                                         
strongly recommended for production servers.
